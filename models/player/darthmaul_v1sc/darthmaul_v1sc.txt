Darth Maul Deathmatch Model
3D artist: Nobody of 3-A
Description: Darth Maul, the very cool dark jedi from the new Star Wars prequels.

Create a DarthMaul folder in the 
\sierra\half-life\valve\models\player folder,
then place these files in it.

The .mdl file is the model you will see during play.  The .bmp file is
necessary for the model to be selectable via the launcher interface.  For
a player model to be visible to all clients playing, it must be installed on
the server for it to propogate to all playing clients.

When a model is downloaded from the game server, it does not download the
.bmp file necessary for selecting the model in the interface: models must be
deliberately installed by the player.

Sorry, I only know how to modify skins, not create new models from scratch;
hence no long, flowing black hooded robe.



Happy fragging and see you at the prequels!
