S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Bandit Pack for Sven Coop Mod

credits: 
Models: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
Textures: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
First compile (on barney skeleton): Nige111
Final hack & compile for Sven Coop: Napoleon

This model pack was requested on H.I.T. so I have desided to make it. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. model (Bandit) was originally rigged by Nige111. I (Napoleon) have hacked it for use in Sven Coop mod. (I hope he won't mind)

Enjoy using this pack. In order to se it, keep this file with the models (five mdl files!)
