Model:Aswat by Ian Waugh
Skin by Brian L. David AKA -No_One~, MaelsTroM,

YOU MUST RENAME THESE FILES TO Grunt and migrate them to opposing Force As
Grunt.Bmp   -  Grunt.Mdl   -   GruntR.txt

Then Rename The Direcory as Well To Grunt

CONCEPT: WHY USE A MOD. Plenty Of NEWBIES  and NEW MOdels. 
Replace your Default models in OP4 with MY NEW SET OF MECHS for Military 
and Use The MaelsTroM Series and others as the REST!!!IF you DON'T
